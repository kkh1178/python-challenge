# In this challenge, you get to be the boss. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing 
# Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, 
# and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the
# new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

# Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required 
# format. Your script will need to do the following:

        # Import the employee_data1.csv and employee_data2.csv files, which currently holds employee records like the below:
                # Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State
                # 214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida
                # 15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado
                # 411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania

        # Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:
                # Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
                # 214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
                # 15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
                # 411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA

# In summary, the required conversions are as follows:

# 1) The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.

# 2) The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.

# 3) The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.

# 4) The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
